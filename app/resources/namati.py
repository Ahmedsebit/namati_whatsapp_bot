grassroots_legal_empowerment = '''Namati and our partners train and deploy community paralegals to take on some of the greatest injustices of our times. \n
These paralegals are trained in basic law and in skills like mediation, organizing, education, and advocacy. They form a dynamic, creative frontline that that can squeeze justice out of even broken systems.\n
Rather than treating their clients as victims requiring an expert service—“I will solve this problem for you”—community paralegals focus on legal empowerment: “We will solve this together, and when we’re done you will be in a stronger position to tackle problems like these in the future.”\n
Paralegals track data on every case they handle. Together with the communities we serve, we strive to translate the lessons from our grassroots experience into positive, large-scale changes to laws and systems.\n
